Version: 1.5
Date: May 12, 2025
Author: Gemini (AI Assistant)

Changelog:
- v1.1: Initial requirements and core features
- v1.4: Modular multi-voice selection for audio Q&A (English voices, gender grouping)
- v1.5: Modular language selection (English/Hindi), Hindi voice support, language-specific voice filtering

Project Goal: To develop an interactive web application enabling users to upload various file types, ask questions about their content (with live audio Q&A), and receive AI-powered answers, including information fetched from the internet if not present in the uploaded file.

1. Introduction & Overview
This document outlines the requirements for an AI-powered web application designed for versatile data and content analysis. Users will be able to upload files (CSV, Word documents, images, audio files), interact with the system using natural language queries (text or voice), and receive insightful answers. The system will leverage a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), web search capabilities, and real-time audio processing to provide a seamless and intelligent user experience. This project is intended as a student project, emphasizing cost-effective solutions and leveraging free/hobbyist tiers of services where possible.

2. Goals and Objectives
Primary Goal: Enable users to gain insights and answers from various types of uploaded files through an intuitive Q&A interface.

Key Objectives:
- Support file uploads for CSVs, Word documents (.docx), images (.jpg, .jpeg), and audio files (.mp3, .wav) for maximum file size of 60MB.
- Implement a robust Q&A system capable of understanding user queries related to the uploaded file content.
- Integrate a multimodal LLM to analyze and interpret text, image, and transcribed audio data.
- Provide a live, low-latency audio Q&A interface (user speaks, system responds with voice).
- Enable the system to search the internet for answers if the information is not found in the uploaded file.
- Allow users to request and discover relevant datasets from the internet.
- Ensure the application is cost-effective to build and run, suitable for a student project.

3. Target Audience
- Students, researchers, and individuals needing quick analysis or information extraction from various file types without complex software.
- Users who prefer voice interaction for querying and receiving information.

4. Functional Requirements

4.1. User Registration & Authentication (Out of Scope for V1)
For simplicity in a student project, V1 will not require user accounts. Sessions might be managed temporarily if needed for context.

4.2. File Upload & Management
FR4.2.1: Users must be able to upload files one at a time.
FR4.2.2: Supported file types:
- CSV (.csv)
- Word Documents (.docx)
- PDF Documents (.pdf)
- Images (.jpg, .jpeg)
- Audio Files (.mp3, .wav)
FR4.2.3: The system must provide clear feedback on successful uploads or errors (e.g., unsupported file type, size limit exceeded).
FR4.2.4: A reasonable file size limit of 60 MB should be enforced to manage costs and processing time with local browser storage if needed.

4.3. Content Analysis & Processing
FR4.3.1: Upon successful upload, the system must detect the file type.
FR4.3.2 (CSV): Extract tabular data. The LLM should be able to understand queries about rows, columns, basic aggregations (sum, average, count), and trends if date columns are present. The system should support visualization capabilities including column distribution plots and correlation matrices.
FR4.3.3 (Word): Extract all text content. The LLM should be able to answer questions based on this text.
FR4.3.4 (PDF): Process PDF documents using a modular approach with specialized components:
  - Core PDF utilities for basic PDF handling and metadata extraction
  - Financial document processing for bank statements, invoices, and similar documents
  - Simple text extraction for general PDF content
  - PDF.js integration for advanced PDF processing
  The system should handle encrypted, scanned, and binary PDFs gracefully with appropriate user feedback.
FR4.3.5 (Image): Process the image. The LLM (multimodal) should be able to describe the image, identify objects, and answer questions about its visual content.
FR4.3.6 (Audio File): Transcribe the audio content to text. The LLM should be able to answer questions based on the transcribed text.

4.4. Question & Answer Interface
FR4.4.1 (Text Input): Users must be able to type questions into a text input field.
FR4.4.2 (Live Audio Input): Users must be able to ask questions using their voice via a microphone. The system should capture audio in real-time.
FR4.4.3 (Query Understanding): The system (via LLM) must interpret the user's natural language question in the context of the uploaded file.
FR4.4.4 (Response Generation - File Context): The system must first attempt to answer the question using the content of the uploaded file.
FR4.4.5 (Response Generation - Web Search): If the answer cannot be found in the file, or if the query implies external knowledge, the system must automatically perform a web search (Google) and synthesize an answer from the search results, citing sources if possible.
FR4.4.6 (Text Output): Answers must be displayed in a clear text format in the UI.
FR4.4.7 (Live Audio Output): Answers must be spoken back to the user with low latency.

4.5. Dataset Discovery
FR4.5.1: Users must be able to submit a text query describing a type of dataset they are looking for (e.g., "latest COVID-19 cases global").
FR4.5.2: The system must use a web search to find potential publicly available datasets matching the query.
FR4.5.3: The system should present a list of potential dataset sources (links) to the user if demanded.
FR4.5.4 (Future V2): Allow users to select a dataset from the search results to be automatically downloaded and analyzed within the app. (V1 focuses on presenting links).

4.6. User Interface (High-Level)
FR4.6.1: Clean, intuitive, and user-friendly interface.
FR4.6.2: Clear sections for file upload, query input (text/voice controls), and answer display.
FR4.6.3: Visual feedback for system status (e.g., "processing...", "listening...", "speaking...").
FR4.6.4: Visualization tab for displaying data visualizations like column distributions and correlation matrices.
FR4.6.5: Detailed progress indicators showing the current processing stage, especially for PDF files.

4.7. Audio Q&A and Voice Features
--------------------------------

**Overview:**
The platform provides a modular, extensible audio Q&A experience, allowing users to interact with the system using both text and voice. All audio features are designed as modular components for easy extension and maintenance.

**Features:**
- **Live Audio Q&A:** Users can ask questions and receive answers via voice at any time, regardless of file upload status.
- **Voice Selection:**
  - Users can choose from multiple available voices for audio responses.
  - Voices are grouped by gender (e.g., "Lady Voices", "Manly Voices") for clarity.
  - At least two voices per gender are shown if available.
- **Language Selection:**
  - Users can select the language for spoken responses (currently "English" and "Hindi").
  - When "Hindi" is selected, only Hindi-compatible voices (e.g., "Rishi", "Google हिन्दी") are shown.
  - Spoken answers use the correct language and voice for natural pronunciation.
  - If no voices for the selected language are available, the app falls back to the best available option.
- **Modular Implementation:**
  - All audio logic is encapsulated in a modular `useSpeech` hook.
  - UI controls for voice and language selection are modular and do not disrupt existing layout or CSS.
- **Accessibility:**
  - Audio controls are always visible and usable, supporting both text and voice-first users.
- **Extensibility:**
  - The architecture supports easy addition of more languages or premium TTS providers in the future.

**Version History for Audio Q&A:**
- v1.4: Added modular multi-voice selection and gender grouping for voices.
- v1.5: Added modular language selection (English/Hindi), Hindi voice support, and language-specific voice filtering.

5. Non-Functional Requirements
NFR5.1 (Performance):
- Live audio Q&A should have minimal perceptible latency (target <2-3 seconds round trip for STT -> LLM -> TTS).
- File processing time should be reasonable (e.g., <30 seconds for average file sizes).

NFR5.2 (Usability):
- Easy to learn and use, even for non-technical users.
- Clear error messages and guidance.

NFR5.3 (Scalability):
- While V1 is a student project, the architecture should allow for future scaling if needed.

NFR5.4 (Security):
- Basic security measures for API key protection.
- No sensitive user data should be stored.

NFR5.5 (Cost-Effectiveness):
- Prioritize free tiers and low-cost services.
- Implement measures to prevent accidental high usage of paid APIs.

NFR5.6 (Reliability):
- The application should handle common errors gracefully (e.g., API failures, network issues, malformed files).
- The PDF processing should be robust, with multiple fallback mechanisms when primary extraction methods fail.
- The application should provide helpful feedback when processing problematic files.

6. System Architecture

The system can be implemented using one of two architectural approaches:

6.1. Frontend-Only Architecture (Recommended for Simplicity)

This approach implements all functionality directly in the browser, minimizing complexity and deployment requirements:

- Frontend (React, Vue, or Angular): Handles UI, user interactions, file uploads, and all processing logic.
  - File Processing: Uses browser APIs and JavaScript libraries to process files directly in the browser.
  - API Integration: Makes direct API calls to external services (Gemini API, Google Search).
  - Audio Processing: Uses Web Speech API for speech-to-text and text-to-speech.
  - State Management: Uses browser storage (localStorage, sessionStorage) for temporary data.

Benefits of Frontend-Only Architecture:
- Simpler development and deployment
- No backend infrastructure required
- Easier to set up and maintain
- Lower hosting costs (can be deployed on GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.)

Limitations of Frontend-Only Architecture:
- API keys must be managed carefully (use environment variables)
- Limited processing power for very large files
- Browser compatibility considerations
- Relies on client-side processing

6.2. Frontend-Backend Architecture (For Advanced Features)

For more complex requirements or better security, a backend can be added:

- Frontend: Handles UI and user interactions
- Backend (Node.js, Python): Handles file processing, API calls, and business logic
  - API Gateway: Provides endpoints for the frontend
  - File Processing Service: Handles file parsing and analysis
  - LLM Integration Service: Manages interactions with the Gemini API
  - Search Service: Handles web searches

This architecture is more complex but provides better security and scalability.

7. API Requirements (Crucial for Implementation)

7.1. Multimodal LLM API (Google Gemini API Recommended)

Service Provider: Google AI (via Google AI Studio or Google Cloud Vertex AI).
Recommended Model: gemini-1.5-flash-latest or gemini-pro-vision for multimodal tasks.

Purpose:
- Understanding user queries in natural language
- Answering questions based on provided context (extracted file content, image data)
- Analyzing and describing images
- Generating summaries or insights from text
- Deciding when to use web search

7.1.1. JavaScript/TypeScript Implementation (Frontend-Only)

```javascript
// Example: Setting up the Gemini API call in JavaScript/TypeScript
async function queryGeminiAPI(prompt, fileContent, fileType) {
  // Prepare the content based on file type
  const content = [];

  // Add system prompt with context about the file
  content.push({ text: `You are analyzing a ${fileType} file. ${prompt}` });

  // Add file content based on type
  if (fileType === 'csv') {
    // For CSV, send a structured representation
    content.push({ text: `Here is the CSV data: ${fileContent.substring(0, 50000)}` });
  } else if (fileType === 'docx') {
    // For DOCX, send the extracted text
    content.push({ text: `Here is the document content: ${fileContent}` });
  } else if (fileType === 'image') {
    // For images, send base64 data
    content.push({
      inlineData: {
        mimeType: "image/jpeg",
        data: fileContent.split(',')[1] // Extract base64 data from data URL
      }
    });
  } else if (fileType === 'audio') {
    // For audio, send the transcription
    content.push({ text: `Here is the audio transcription: ${fileContent}` });
  }

  // Add the user query
  content.push({ text: prompt });

  // Call the Gemini API
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest:generateContent?key=YOUR_API_KEY`,
    {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        contents: [{ role: 'user', parts: content }],
        generationConfig: {
          temperature: 0.2,
          topK: 40,
          topP: 0.95,
          maxOutputTokens: 4096,
        }
      })
    }
  );

  const data = await response.json();
  return data.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text;
}
```

Important Considerations for Frontend Implementation:
- API keys should be stored in environment variables (.env files)
- Implement proper error handling for API failures
- Consider chunking large files to stay within API limits
- Add retry logic for transient errors

7.1.2. Python Implementation (Backend Option)

```python
import google.generativeai as genai

genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash-latest')

# Example usage
response = model.generate_content("Describe this image.", image_data_object)
print(response.text)
```

7.2. Web Search API (Google Custom Search JSON API)

Service Provider: Google Cloud.
Purpose: Fetching external information when the answer is not in the uploaded file.

7.2.1. JavaScript/TypeScript Implementation (Frontend-Only)

```javascript
// Example: Web search function in JavaScript/TypeScript
async function performWebSearch(query) {
  const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
  const cx = 'YOUR_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID';
  const url = `https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?key=${apiKey}&cx=${cx}&q=${encodeURIComponent(query)}`;

  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const data = await response.json();

    if (data.items && data.items.length > 0) {
      return data.items.map(item => ({
        title: item.title,
        url: item.link,
        snippet: item.snippet
      }));
    }

    return [];
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Web search error:', error);
    throw new Error('Failed to perform web search');
  }
}
```

7.2.2. Python Implementation (Backend Option)

```python
import requests

def perform_web_search(query):
    params = {
        "key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
        "cx": "YOUR_CX_ID",
        "q": query
    }
    response = requests.get("https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1", params=params)
    results = response.json().get("items", [])
    return results
```

7.3. Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS)

7.3.1. Browser Web Speech API (Frontend-Only Implementation)

For speech recognition (STT):

```javascript
function startSpeechRecognition(onResultCallback) {
  const recognition = new (window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition)();
  recognition.lang = 'en-US';
  recognition.interimResults = true;
  recognition.continuous = false;

  recognition.onresult = (event) => {
    const transcript = Array.from(event.results)
      .map(result => result[0].transcript)
      .join('');

    onResultCallback(transcript);
  };

  recognition.onerror = (event) => {
    console.error('Speech recognition error:', event.error);
  };

  recognition.start();
  return recognition; // Return to allow stopping later
}
```

For text-to-speech (TTS):

```javascript
function speakText(text) {
  const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(text);
  utterance.lang = 'en-US';

  // Optional: Select a specific voice
  const voices = window.speechSynthesis.getVoices();
  const preferredVoice = voices.find(voice =>
    voice.name.includes('Google') || voice.name.includes('Female')
  );

  if (preferredVoice) {
    utterance.voice = preferredVoice;
  }

  window.speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);

  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    utterance.onend = resolve;
  });
}
```

7.4. File Parsing (Frontend-Only Implementation)

7.4.1. CSV Files

For CSV files, use JavaScript string manipulation or libraries like PapaParse:

```javascript
// Using PapaParse library (recommended)
function parseCSV(csvContent) {
  // Parse CSV to get headers and data
  const results = Papa.parse(csvContent, { header: true });

  // Extract headers
  const headers = results.meta.fields || [];

  // Get sample data (first 5 rows)
  const sampleData = results.data.slice(0, 5);

  // Count rows
  const rowCount = results.data.length;

  // Create a summary
  const summary = `CSV with ${rowCount} rows and ${headers.length} columns`;

  return {
    headers,
    summary,
    rowCount,
    sampleData,
    fullData: results.data
  };
}

// CSV Visualization Functions
function plotPerColumnDistribution(dataFrame, bins = 10, figSize = 5) {
  // Plot histograms for each numeric column in the dataFrame
  // Parameters:
  // - dataFrame: The parsed CSV data
  // - bins: Number of bins for the histogram (default: 10)
  // - figSize: Size of each subplot (default: 5)

  // Implementation would use a charting library like Chart.js or D3.js
  // to create histograms for each numeric column
}

function plotCorrelationMatrix(dataFrame, figSize = 247) {
  // Plot a correlation matrix for numeric columns in the dataFrame
  // Parameters:
  // - dataFrame: The parsed CSV data
  // - figSize: Size of the correlation matrix plot (default: 247)

  // Implementation would calculate correlations between numeric columns
  // and visualize them using a heatmap
}

// Alternative: Manual CSV parsing without external libraries
function parseCSVManually(csvContent) {
  const lines = csvContent.split('\n');
  const headers = lines[0].split(',').map(header => header.trim());
  const rowCount = lines.length - 1; // -1 for header

  // Get sample data (first 5 rows)
  const sampleData = [];
  for (let i = 1; i <= Math.min(5, rowCount); i++) {
    if (lines[i]) {
      const row = lines[i].split(',');
      const rowObj = {};
      headers.forEach((header, index) => {
        rowObj[header] = row[index];
      });
      sampleData.push(rowObj);
    }
  }

  return {
    headers,
    summary: `CSV with ${rowCount} rows and ${headers.length} columns`,
    rowCount,
    sampleData,
    fullData: [] // Omit full data to save memory
  };
}
```

7.4.2. DOCX Files

For DOCX files, use libraries like mammoth.js:

```javascript
// Using mammoth.js to extract text from DOCX
async function parseDocx(arrayBuffer) {
  // Convert the array buffer to a Blob
  const blob = new Blob([arrayBuffer]);

  // Use mammoth.js to extract text
  const result = await mammoth.extractRawText({ arrayBuffer });
  const text = result.value;

  return {
    content: text,
    summary: `Document with ${text.length} characters`,
    wordCount: text.split(/\s+/).length
  };
}
```

7.4.3. PDF Files

For PDF files, implement a modular approach with specialized components:

```javascript
// Core PDF utilities for basic handling and metadata extraction
async function extractPDFMetadata(pdfData, fileName) {
  try {
    // Extract basic metadata (page count, author, creation date, etc.)
    const metadata = await pdfjsLib.getDocument({ data: pdfData, disableWorker: true }).promise
      .then(pdf => pdf.getMetadata())
      .catch(error => ({ info: { error: 'Failed to extract metadata' } }));

    return {
      fileName,
      pageCount: metadata.info?.numPages || 'Unknown',
      author: metadata.info?.Author || 'Unknown',
      creationDate: metadata.info?.CreationDate || 'Unknown',
      fileSize: `${(pdfData.byteLength / 1024 / 1024).toFixed(2)} MB`
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error extracting PDF metadata:', error);
    return { fileName, error: 'Failed to extract metadata' };
  }
}

// Financial document processing for bank statements, invoices, etc.
function extractFinancialDocumentText(pdfData, fileName) {
  // Specialized extraction for financial documents
  // Looks for patterns like account numbers, dates, transactions, balances
  // Returns structured information about the financial document

  // Implementation would use pattern matching and specialized extraction
  // techniques for different types of financial documents
}

// Simple text extraction for general PDF content
async function extractTextFromPDFSimple(pdfData) {
  // Basic text extraction that doesn't rely on PDF.js workers
  // Useful as a fallback when more advanced methods fail

  // Implementation would use basic pattern matching to extract text
  // from the PDF binary data
}

// PDF.js integration for advanced PDF processing
async function extractTextFromPDF(pdfData, progressCallback, setProcessingStage, fileName) {
  // Multi-layered approach to PDF text extraction:
  // 1. Check if it's a financial document based on the file name
  // 2. If it is, use specialized financial document extraction
  // 3. If not, or if financial extraction fails, use the simple extractor
  // 4. If that fails, try PDF.js with proper error handling
  // 5. If all methods fail, extract information from the file name

  // Implementation would use a combination of the above functions
  // with proper error handling and fallbacks
}
```

7.4.4. Image Files

For images, prepare them for the Gemini API:

```javascript
function processImage(dataUrl) {
  // Extract base64 data from data URL
  const base64Data = dataUrl.split(',')[1];

  return {
    mimeType: 'image/jpeg', // or image/png
    data: base64Data
  };
}
```

7.4.4. Audio Files

For audio files, use the Web Speech API or external services:

```javascript
// This is a placeholder - browser APIs don't directly support audio file transcription
// You would need to use a service like Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
async function transcribeAudio(audioBlob) {
  // In a real implementation, you would:
  // 1. Send the audio to a transcription service
  // 2. Get back the transcribed text

  // For a frontend-only approach, you might:
  // - Use a JavaScript library that can process audio
  // - Or provide instructions for the user to play the audio and use live STT

  return {
    transcription: "Transcription would appear here",
    duration: "Unknown"
  };
}
```
